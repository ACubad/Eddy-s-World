            <div class="description-text"><p class="details">"The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig is literally the ultimate "choose your own adventure" vibe, but make it existential. Nora Seed hits up this magical library where every book is a different version of her life. Like, imagine swiping through lives on an app instead of just pics on Insta. One minute she's living the rock star dream, the next she's chilling with penguins as a scientist. It's the ultimate life glow-up challenge, but with more soul-searching and less filter options. Matt Haig is serving us major "think about your life choices" energy, wrapped in a cozy, universe-hopping narrative. It's for anyone who's ever double-tapped on a life they thought they wanted. Spoiler: it's a journey to finding out that the grass isn't always greener, especially if you're viewing it through someone else's highlight reel.</p>
