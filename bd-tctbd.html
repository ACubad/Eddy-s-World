            <div class="description-text"><p class="details" id="tctbd-p">"The Courage to Be Disliked" by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga is the self-help book you didn't know you needed, serving up a side of psychology with a main course of liberation from societal expectations. This dialogue-based read explores the concepts of Alfred Adler's psychology, arguing that happiness lies in the power of not caring about being liked. It's like finding the secret cheat code to life that lets you dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune—or at least the need for constant approval. The authors propose a radical shift from chasing external validation to fostering internal contentment, challenging readers to consider if what they've been taught about success and happiness might be other people's definitions, not their own. In a world obsessed with likes, this book is a breath of fresh air, encouraging you to live authentically, even if it means ruffling a few feathers along the way.</p>

It's liberating to live your life according to your own values, without seeking approval from everyone.</p>
