            <div class="description-text"><p class="details" id="htst-p">"How to Stop Time" by Matt Haig is a time-exploration tale. Meet Tom Hazard, a man who's been alive for centuries, yet stuck in a perpetual mid-life crisis. His condition? An extremely slow aging process that makes tortoises look hasty. As a history teacher who's actually lived through the periods he teaches, Tom is the ultimate primary source. The catch? He must not fall in love, because nothing complicates immortality like heartbreak. This book takes you on a journey through time, from Elizabethan England to Jazz Age Paris, all while exploring the timeless struggles of love, loss, and trying to find a decent cup of coffee that's been consistent through the centuries. It's a poignant reminder that, sometimes, to truly live, you have to stop worrying about time.</p>

            <p class="notes-sub-section">"The first rule is that you don't fall in love,' I said. 'There are other rules too, but that is the main one. No falling in love."-From this, the narrator tries to tell us that forming deep emotional connections complicates life, especially when you're trying to navigate the complexities of time and existence.</p>
