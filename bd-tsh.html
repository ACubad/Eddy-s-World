            <div class="description-text"><p class="details" id="tsh-p">"The Secret History" by Donna Tartt is what happens when you mix a little too much ancient Greek with a dash of drama and a pinch of "let's do something wild." Imagine your study group deciding that the best way to ace the class is to live like you're in ancient times, but with more scandal and way less chill. Tartt gives us this squad of college kids who are all about that aesthetic life, except their definition includes a bit of crime to spice things up. It's a murder mystery that's less about the "oops" and more about the "why though?" making you rethink every group project you've ever hated. If you're into tales of ambition, beauty, and the kind of decisions that make you go "maybe let's stick to quizzes," then buckle up. This book is like a dark academia TikTok trend gone way too far, proving that sometimes, too much homework can indeed be deadly.</p>
